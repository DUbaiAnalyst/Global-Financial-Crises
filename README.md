# Global-Financial-Crises
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to reveal the true economic well-being of people across countries by using the Relative Purchasing Power (RPP) index to measure how far the average income can cover the real cost of living. By analyzing 139 countries, the project highlights hidden global inequality, showing where people face financial strain despite being employed and earning income. It challenges traditional economic measures like GDP and nominal wages, which often overlook affordability, and instead evaluates real living standards. The project identifies regions under severe financial pressure, highlights models of economic efficiency, and encourages policymakers, investors, and development agencies to focus on improving real purchasing power rather than just increasing income. Overall, its goal is to promote economic fairness and ensure that average citizens in every country can afford a basic and dignified standard of living.

## Questions (KPQs)
- To what extent does the average local income cover the total, combined cost of living and rent across different nations?
- Which continents or regional groups face a state of "Critical Strain," where average income is insufficient to cover basic living expenses (RPP < 1)?
- How significant is the gap in real purchasing power between the most financially strained country in the sample and the country with the strongest RPP?
- In which cases do high local wages fail to translate into superior relative purchasing power due to high comprehensive costs?
- What combination of local purchasing power and cost of living leads to the achievement of "Exceptional" relative wealth (RPP > 5)?
- Are current global economic policies and aid efforts successfully ensuring that the average citizen achieves an essential economic surplus (RPP > 1) globally?

## Process
